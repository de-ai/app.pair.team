### Design Engine

## What is Design Engine?

Design Engine is a design platform built for engineers. From open source projects to enterprise apps, you can inspect design files, download parts, copy code, and build interfaces faster.

Below are 5 ways you can use Design Engine…

## 1. Automatic Specs
Design Engine parses design project's files and automatically produces real-time specifications for every single view. Every page, art-board, layer, component, slice, group, and hot zone element gets analyzed, measured, and documented for distribution. This dramatically speeds up R&D and production time spent going back and forth with designers to make sure their views were implemented correctly.

## 2. Instant Interface Parts
Design Engine processes every design file's slice, button, and icon for export every time you upload a new file. Whether you are developing an iOS 12 Mobile Application or an Android Tablet App, Design Engine handles every part neatly & organizes them along with design source for project integration.

## 3. Copy/Paste Code Examples
"Add Ons" are Design Engine's second platform release. Using Design Engine's API, Engineers can develop custom Add Ons to render code for any framework. Add On's allow engineers across your organization to inspect, copy, and re-use code from every layer, slice, button, element from your design projects files.

## 4. No Software Required
The Design Engine Platform is intended to scale without the worry or commitment to any specific design tool or development framework. Our platform of design tools for engineers does not require any IDE or download of the native design source file's format.

## 5. Community Design
Engineers can use Design Engine to explore public interface designs from our community of designers from around the world. Similar to how GitHub or CodePen designers and engineers can Clone or download public projects for their own usage. We hope to see some exciting collaborations from designers and engineers around the world.
