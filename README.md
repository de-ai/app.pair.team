## Welcome to Design Engine

Design Engine is a design platform built for engineers. From open source projects to enterprise apps, you can inspect designs, download parts, copy code, and build interfaces faster.

Design Engine automates unnecessary and repetitive design production tasks that slow engineering projects down. Designers upload their files and invite engineering teammates, Design Engine handles the rest. Design Engine parses design project's files and automatically produces real-time specifications of every view. Every page, art-board, layer, component, slice, group, and hot zone element gets analyzed, measured, and documented for distribution. This dramatically speeds up R&D and production time spent going back and forth with design teams to make sure their views are implemented correctly. The Design Engine Platform is also intended to scale without the worry or commitment to any specific design tool or development framework. Our platform of design tools does not require any IDE or to download of the native design source file's format.
